# SEQ-Live-Map

This project has been ongoing since the end of 2023. I was first introduced to Leaflet in my final year of high school, and it quickly became clear that I wanted to build something more substantial with it. During high school, I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, skills that I have continued to develop and apply throughout my university studies.

This map displays trains, buses, and ferries across South East Queensland in real time. It also includes additional toggleable layers that show parks, railways, alternative map tiles, and other features. There is also a tracing feature that can trace where a vehicle has been before.
